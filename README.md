# A simple implementation of an open-addressed hash table

This repository contains an implementation of a simple hash table using string keys that uses open addressing for collision resolution.  The hash table is specified in `hash.h` and implemented in `hash.c`.  There is also a small program in `test_hash.c` to demonstrate the hash table.  You can compile this program using the provided `Makefile` and run it as follows:
```
make
./test_hash
```
